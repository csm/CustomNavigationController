This is a reimplementation of UINavigationController, with some extra features, and some missing features.

The biggest added feature is it supports different animation directions, which can be helpful for doing different kinds of transitions. For example, I made an application where you switch between view controllers (kind of like a tab bar controller) and the transitions animate up and down.

This code isn't really set up in a project as-is, just include it in your project. You will want to:

  - Subclass CustomViewController if your content view controller previously subclassed UIViewController, or
  - Subclass CustomTableViewController if your content view controller previously subclassed UITableViewController, and
  - Use the property customNavigationController instead of navigationController.

That's the extent of the documentation you'll get for now. Read the code :)
